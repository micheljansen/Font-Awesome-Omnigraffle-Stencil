Font Awesome Omnigraffle Stencil
================================

This Omnigraffle stencil contains all the icons in [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io) 3.2.1 as vectorised path objects. This means you can use them without having Font Awesome installed and without worrying about font issues when exporting to PDF. All the icons are vector objects, so you can freely resize them as objects in OmniGraffle, but they are not text. If you prefer your icons to behave like text, you can use [Pat Cheung's stencil](https://github.com/patcheung/Font-Awesome-OmniGraffle-Stencil) instead. 

## Using
1. [Download the Stencil](https://github.com/micheljansen/Font-Awesome-Omnigraffle-Stencil/archive/master.zip) (click "Download Zip on the right").
2. Double-click the Stencil to open it in Omnigraffle.
3. Click "install" in the top right corner of the stencil (optional).
